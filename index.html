            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science focused on developing systems that can
                perform
                tasks requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, reasoning, perception, and
                language
                understanding. AI is generally classified into two types: Narrow AI, which is designed for specific
                tasks
                like facial recognition and chatbots, and General AI, which is a theoretical concept where machines
                could
                possess human-like intelligence across multiple domains.

                AI has numerous applications across industries. Machine Learning (ML) enables AI to learn from data and
                make
                predictions, while Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows AI to understand and generate human
                language, as
                seen in chatbots and translation tools. Computer vision helps AI interpret visual data, playing a
                crucial
                role in areas like facial recognition and autonomous vehicles. In robotics, AI enhances automation in
                manufacturing, healthcare, and space exploration. Additionally, AI has transformed healthcare by aiding
                in
                disease diagnosis, drug development, and personalized treatments.

                Despite its advancements, AI presents challenges and ethical concerns. Issues such as bias in AI models,
                job
                displacement due to automation, and privacy risks have raised concerns about its societal impact.
                Security
                threats, including AI-driven cyberattacks and deepfake technology, also pose risks. As AI continues to
                evolve, governments and organizations are working to establish regulations and frameworks to ensure
                responsible and ethical development. While challenges remain, AI continues to revolutionize industries,
                enhancing efficiency and innovation in various fields.Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of
